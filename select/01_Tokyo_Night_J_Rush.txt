Look around, take your rock inside
Do you know you drive me crazy?
Stop the sound, deep into my mind
Put the colours in my life

When I change my mind
I just wanna love you forever
I'm crazy tonight oh babe
Ready to fly, I'm feeling my passion

Tokyo night, all the time
Tokyo night, I'm looking for freedom
Ready to fly, I dance to the rhythm
I can lose control babe

Tokyo night, take my life
Tokyo night, I'm living without you
Tokyo night, ready to fly
Just an illusion go!!, love me tonight

Don't you know life is not a game
Can't you feel my hard is ready
Stop the night I can be all right
Take my freedom make me cry

When I change my mind
I just wanna love you forever
I'm crazy tonight oh babe
Ready to fly, I'm feeling my passion

Tokyo night, all the time
Tokyo night, I'm looking for freedom
Ready to fly, I dance to the rhythm
I can lose control babe

Tokyo night, take my life
Tokyo night, I'm living without you
Tokyo night, ready to fly
Just an illusion go!!, love me tonight
